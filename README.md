# [Squares!](http://hackers.cool/~margo/squares.html)

This project started from a simple doodle that I like to do of squares. I found that they start to make cool patterns when you overlay multiple grids, and the width of the edges is the same as the distance between squares, and the size of the squares is some multiple of that base width. It's also, mostly, a fun exercise in manipulating things in the DOM using straight Javascript. 

### Still to-do:

* Make squares delete more rapidly so that the screen never fills up with squares
* Possibly add new layers of gridding, or restrict grids so that squares can never end up with aligned edges
* Use event loop rather than setTimeout()
* Refactor to use functional programming techniques
